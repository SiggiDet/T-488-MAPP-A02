## Assignment 2: Contactor

A simple contact app. User is able to add name, number and a contact photo. Contacts are listed in a row. Each contact can be clicked to view contact screen. Calling is possible from contact screen.  


#### System setup

Clone the gitlab repository https://github.com/SiggiDet/T-488-MAPP-A02.git to an empty folder on your computer.

Here is how: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

1. Switch to the project's root directory in terminal
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Once, 'npm install' is completed, run `expo start` to start the expo and react-native server
4. If it shows a QR code on the terminal as a result of 'exp start' command, then you are good to go!

#### Mobile setup

1. Install 'Expo' application on your android/iOS device. You can find the links to Android and iOS apps [here](https://expo.io/tools#client).
2. Scan the QR code shown on the terminal.
3. Once the QR code is successfully scanned, it will take few seconds to load and render the app.
