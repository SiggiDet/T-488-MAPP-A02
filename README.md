Code red! I repeat code red! The native Contacts application in iOS and Android has been wiped  out clean and nobody can find the source code. The IMDC (International Mobile Device  Committee) has contacted us in order to release a new software which can replace the native  Contact application (at least for the time being). This is where you come in, to take over this  operation and deliver a new Contact application. As always, failure is not an option!
